# Prettier plugin Zig

A prettier plugin for the Zig programming language from [plasmo](https://www.plasmo.com/).

NOTE: This project is currently stalled until the release of Prettier v3, when the plugin system will support async parser/printer, which would enable running a WASM parser.

`zig fmt` seems to do the job already so we will stick to that. Maybe fix the vscode package to use the wasm module instead of invoking zig cli! -> We can certainly do that! Perhaps even inlining the wasm, which will let us use the plugin even in web environment.

A potential approach to fix this issue is to use deasync package, however that sounds like a cumbersome hack for something that people might not want or even care about.
